This repository contains all language files for [iRedAdmin-Pro](https://www.iredmail.org/admin_panel.html).

How to help translate:

* Fork this repository
* Translate file `<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/iredadmin.po`, then send us a pull request.
  If your language doesn't exist, feel free to create a new one.

We will convert translated po file and commit to this repository again, you
can download it and override the file in your iRedAdmin-Pro directory, then
restart Apache or uwsgi (if you're running Nginx) service.

Your help is greatly appreciated. :)
